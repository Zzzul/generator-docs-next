# Introduction

![Full Version](/full-version.png)

![Simple Version](/simple-version.png)

[Generator](https://github.com/Evdigi-INA/generator) is an open-source Laravel toolkit for building essential administration interfaces with ease. Featuring comprehensive CRUD operations, it acts as a minimalistic template or a robust starting point for developing CMS systems, admin panels, and other web applications requiring CRUD functionality.

## The Reason
We've all spent too much time building <s>master</s> main data management systems repeatedly. This package allows you to focus on your application's core features instead. Use that saved time to sleep, play video games, or even touch some grass.

## Who We Are

We are a group of freelance developers based in Bekasi, Indonesia ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡©, working on side projects. Our mission is to make a difference by helping people create their own projects through open-source and free software like our creations.

## Pricing

Dont worry, it's 100% free & open source.
